# ChiselEdge Proxy

This is source code to the ChiselEdge Proxy that provides a SQLite-compatible API.

## Verifying the ABI

You can verify what the ABI looks like by running `cbindgen`:

```console
cbindgen -c cbindgen.toml src/lib.rs
```

When adding new SQLite APIs make sure that the function signatures in the header file generated by `cbindgen` match SQLite.

## Building a small library

To build the smallest possible dynamic library, run:

```console
cargo +nightly build \
	-Z build-std=std,panic_abort \
	-Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort \
	--release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```
