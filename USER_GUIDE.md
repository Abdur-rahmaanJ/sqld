# `sqld` User Guide

## Deploying to Fly

You can use the existing `fly.toml` file from this repository.

Just run
```console
flyctl launch
```
... then pick a name and respond "Yes" when the prompt asks you to deploy.

You now have `sqld` running on Fly listening for HTTP connections.

Give it a try with this snippet, replacing `$YOUR_APP` with your app name:
```
curl -X POST -d '{"statements": ["create table testme(a,b,c)"]}' $YOUR_APP.fly.dev
curl -X POST -d '{"statements": ["insert into testme values(1,2,3)"]}' $YOUR_APP.fly.dev
curl -X POST -d '{"statements": ["select * from testme"]}' $YOUR_APP.fly.dev
```
```
[{"b":2,"a":1,"c":3}]
```
